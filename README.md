# Slide to Confirm

This is a custom card for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) designed to prevent accidental button presses by requiring the user perform a successful sliding action from left to right to trigger a service.

Use case: You have a button that can remotely unlock your front door, but you most likely don't have an automated method to close the door if it was opened accidentally.  Slide to Confirm requires that you slide the indicator across the card to perform an action.

This is quite rudimentary and was created for my own needs, but I'm happy to share it with the community and incorporate any improvements you want to add through pull requests.

### `confirm_action`

## Usage

After installation, edit your dashboard and click the "Add Card" button. Choose the "Manual" box at the very bottom. The card must be configured manually as shown here:

### Basic example — target an entity

```yaml
type: custom:slide-confirm-card
sliders:
  - name: Front Door
    icon: mdi:door
    textUnconfirmed: Slide to Unlock
    textConfirmed: Door Unlocked!
    iconUnconfirmed: mdi:lock
    iconConfirmed: mdi:lock-open
    confirm_action:
      action: call-service
      service: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: input_boolean.slide_confirm
```

### Passing service data

Use the `data` key to send additional parameters to services that require them:

```yaml
  - name: Front door fingerprint reader
    icon: mdi:fingerprint
    textUnconfirmed: Slide to start enrolling
    textConfirmed: Enroll started!
    iconUnconfirmed: mdi:lock
    iconConfirmed: mdi:lock-open
    confirm_action:
      action: call-service
      service: esphome.fingerprint_enroll
      data:
        finger_id: 1
        num_scans: 5
```

### Targeting a device

```yaml
  - name: Back Door
    textUnconfirmed: Slide to Unlock
    textConfirmed: Door Unlocked!
    iconUnconfirmed: mdi:lock
    iconConfirmed: mdi:lock-open
    confirm_action:
      action: call-service
      service: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        device_id: device123
```

### Targeting an area

```yaml
  - name: Garage Doors
    textUnconfirmed: Slide to Unlock
    textConfirmed: Doors Unlocked!
    iconUnconfirmed: mdi:lock
    iconConfirmed: mdi:lock-open
    confirm_action:

      service: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        area_id: garage
```
